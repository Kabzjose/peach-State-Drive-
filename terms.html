    <div class="container">
        
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Peach State Drive Rentals</strong>. By booking a vehicle with us, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before finalizing your reservation.</p>

        <h2>1. Driver Qualifications & Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>To rent a vehicle from Peach State Drive Rentals, the primary driver must meet the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Must be at least <span class="highlight">21 years of age</span>. Renters between the ages of 21 and 24 may be subject to a "Young Driver Fee."</li>
            <li>Must possess a <span class="highlight">valid, government-issued driver’s license</span> that has been active for at least one year.</li>
            <li>International drivers must present a valid passport and an international driver’s permit if their license is not in English.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Insurance & Liability</h2>
        <p>Proof of active automotive insurance coverage is required for all rentals. Your policy must provide full coverage (liability, collision, and comprehensive) that extends to rental vehicles.</p>
        <p>If you do not have personal coverage, you may be required to purchase a protection package from us or a third-party provider. The Renter is responsible for any damage to the vehicle not covered by insurance.</p>

        <h2>3. Security Deposit & Payment</h2>
        <p>A refundable security deposit is required at the time of booking or pickup. The amount may vary based on the vehicle class (e.g., Luxury vs. Economy). This deposit will be refunded within 3–5 business days after the vehicle is returned, provided there are no damages or additional fees.</p>

        <h2>4. Fuel Policy</h2>
        <p>All vehicles are provided with a <strong>full tank of fuel</strong> (or full charge for electric vehicles). Renters are expected to return the vehicle with the same fuel level.</p>
        <p>If the vehicle is returned with less than a full tank, a refueling fee will be charged at current market rates plus a service surcharge.</p>

        <h2>5. Vehicle Usage & Prohibited Acts</h2>
        <p>To ensure the safety and cleanliness of our fleet, the following acts are strictly prohibited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Smoking:</strong> Smoking of any kind (cigarettes, vaping, marijuana) is strictly prohibited inside the vehicle. A cleaning fee of up to <span class="highlight">$250</span> will be assessed for violations.</li>
            <li><strong>No Off-Roading:</strong> Vehicles must remain on paved roads at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>No Pets:</strong> Unless prior approval is granted, pets are not allowed in the vehicles to prevent allergens and damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Mileage Limits</h2>
        <p>Daily mileage limits may apply depending on the specific vehicle selected. Please refer to your specific rental agreement for details. Excess mileage will be charged at a rate of <strong>$0.35 per mile</strong>.</p>

        <h2>7. Return Policy & Late Fees</h2>
        <p>Vehicles must be returned by the agreed-upon date and time. A grace period of <strong>1 hour</strong> is permitted. Returns exceeding the grace period may incur an additional full-day rental charge.</p>

        <h2>8. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>We understand plans change. You may cancel your reservation for a full refund up to <strong>24 hours before your scheduled pickup time</strong>. Cancellations made within 24 hours of pickup will incur a $20 cancellation fee.</p>

        <h2>9. Accident & Damage Reporting</h2>
        <p>In the event of an accident or damage to the vehicle, the Renter must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Immediately contact local authorities (police) if there are injuries or significant damage.</li>
            <li>Contact Peach State Drive Rentals support at (555) 123-4567 within 1 hour of the incident.</li>
            <li>Obtain an official police report and insurance information from other involved parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failure to report an accident promptly may result in forfeiture of insurance coverage and the Renter assuming full liability.</p>
